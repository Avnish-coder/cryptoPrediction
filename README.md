# cryptoPrediction

Project's title is Crypto Prediction. This is  a web scrapping project and gives a future crypto currency that has the best scope in the future as result in json file. if you want to run this project in your system then you have to install some modules of the nodejs. These are three dependancies of nodejs fs , cheerio, request module. Basically   The project is fetching the data of crypto currencies from the two different websites. fetched top 30 crypto currencies and some essential things related to the crypto for example : market cap, current price, volume, last year percentage, all time high price, low range and high range etc and push these things into an object and push that object into an array then typecast that array into a string by json.stringfy and then stored them into a json file. read that data from the json file by the fs.readFileSync then parse into an array then called a function by passing last year percentage and current price and that function gives the last year value and then i called other function pass current price and the last year value as parameters to that fucntion that gives the actual fluctuation between the crypto currency filter that currency into a json file and then display that currency in console and stored into a new json file that was my project thank you.
